        <h1>Dear Kevin,</h1>
        
        <p>
            Hey, how are you doing? <br>
            Semoga hari-hari lu lagi baik, apalagi ini udah last day ujian dan bentar lagi libur. I hope you’re feeling a bit lighter now.
            I didn’t really plan this as anything big, I just wanted to take a moment to say thank you, in my own way. This is just a small thing, but it’s meant to appreciate you, and everything so far.
        </p>

            Honestly, this year has been a lot. Not in a dramatic way, but in that quiet, exhausting kind where you’re constantly thinking, building things, fixing things, pushing yourself forward even when you’re tired. I don’t think I say this often, but I’m actually grateful for that part of me, the one that keeps going, keeps creating, keeps trying to understand how things work instead of giving up. It’s messy, it’s imperfect, but it’s real. And for now, that’s enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for being a part of my story so far, genuinely. I’m really grateful for that, and I look forward to more stories ahead, whatever shape they take.
            I hope you get to spend the holidays well, with the people you love. <b>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!</b> ✨
        </p>
